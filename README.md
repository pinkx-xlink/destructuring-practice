# destructuring-practice
Just some simple destructuring practice I wanted to do in-between projects so that I have a solid understanding of this important tool before running to implement it into my work...

I'm currently working on a library project for The Odin Project that emunlates Kindle; you can store books in your library, or use input to add a new book and toggle whether or not you've read it. 
I was sailing confidently through the project until I realized that I had some unreachable code that I couldn't seem to figure out a loophole for... I was able to get the user's input, assign it to variables, and log it to the console, but accessing the code within that function used to pull that input stumped me. Maybe I just needed to add some prototype magic somewhere, or maybe sprinkling in this. might do it..? I knew there must be some fantastical way to get that code, and it just so happens that destructuring seems to be exactly what I was looking for! 

I didn't want to muck up my project code too much before I knew what I was doing, so consider these code examples my little destructuring playground! My main goal here is to try out multiple different types of destructuring and from there decide which one is the best fit for creating new HTML objects dynamically from input, but I can tell that this is very powerful and will make a world of difference in my work from here on out.
